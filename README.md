# Python-Api-Challenge
Python Api Challenge 6 (World_Weather_Analysis)

In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
